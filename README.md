# DoodleClassifier
Similar to Google Quick Draw
Using the QuickDraw Dataset the Network is trained to classify the drawings in 3 categories..Train, Rainbow or Cats.
Still it doesnot work as per the expectation due to issues like-
1. Less Training Data
2. Never Answers "None of the 3" because it is trained with other doodles to respond negative if tested with other doodles.
3. Other issues will be updated.
